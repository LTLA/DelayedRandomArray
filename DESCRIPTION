Package: DelayedRandomArray
Version: 0.99.0
Date: 2021-04-11
Description: Implements a DelayedArray of random values,
    where the realization of the sampled values is delayed until they are needed.
    Reproducible sampling within any subarray is achieved by chunking;
    each chunk is initialized with a different random seed and stream.
